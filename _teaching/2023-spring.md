## Course information
This is an undergraduate course in the study of graphs. Graphs appear all over the place: both in pure and applied mathematics as well as other sciences, such as chemistry, physics, computer science, and linguistics. We will focus on the theoretical aspects of graph theory, although we will also discuss some applications. 

### Course objectives
* learn about basic properties of graphs (bipartite, Eulerian, matchings, connectivity, colorability, planarity,...)
* prove foundational results (Menger, Hall matching, matrix tree, Kuratowski,...); 
* understand theoretical trends in graph theory (TONCAS, duality, extremal problems, Ramsey theory); 
* investigate connections of graph theory to different areas (combinatorics, topology, linear algebra, probability); 
* improve your ability to read/write proofs and critique arguments; 
* be exposed to things you haven’t seen and be challenged through problem solving.



## Recommended prerequisites

Some experience with writing proofs. 

## Textbook
West, _Introduction to graph theory_ 

## Course expenses
Just the textbook. In practice, the text may not be absolutely necessary for the course, although you may want it as a reference. 

## Grading
homework 50%, midterm 25%, final project 25%

* a grade of 90% or higher is guaranteed an A
* a grade of 80% or higher is guaranteed an B
* a grade of 70% or higher is guaranteed an C

## Homework 

There will be weekly assignments posted below as the semester progresses. The homework is designed to increase your engagement with the material, with your peers, and with me.

Collaboration: Please collaborate! Working together with your classmates can help you learn the material better. Some of the homework problems may be difficult, so it is recommended that you talk to someone when you are stuck. You are required to write your solutions alone and acknowledge the students you worked with. For any solution you submit, you should understand it well enough that you can explain it to someone else and answer questions about it. If you find yourself writing down things that you can’t explain, you should go back and think more about the problem. 

LaTeX: Homework solutions must be typed in LaTeX. If you're new to LaTeX, you can either [download](https://www.latex-project.org/get/) LaTex or use [sharelatex](https://www.sharelatex.com/) which allows you download, edit, and compile LaTeX files online. See [here](https://oeis.org/wiki/List_of_LaTeX_mathematical_symbols) for some commonly used symbols in LaTeX. Also [Detexify](http://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html) is a useful tool for finding the commands for various symbols. The source code for the assignments should be a helpful guide. The most basic thing to know/remember is that math always goes in between dollar signs. 

Late homework policy: For your homework grade, I will drop the score from your lowest assignment. View this as a one-time "get out of jail free card" in the event that you oversleep, forget, have a midterm, etc. As a general rule, late homework will not be accepted. If you suspect you won’t be able to submit the assignment in time, please notify me as soon as possible. 

### Homework assignments. 

HW1 (due 2/3).

## Final Project
Working in groups of 2-3, you’ll choose some topic related to the course that you want to investigate further. More details to come.
