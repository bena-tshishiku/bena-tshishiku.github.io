## Announcements

* (1/18). This webpage has the syllabus for the course. Please read it carefully. 


## Course information
This is an undergraduate course in the study of graphs. Graphs appear all over the place: both in pure and applied mathematics as well as other sciences, such as chemistry, physics, computer science, and linguistics. We will focus on the theoretical aspects of graph theory, although we will also discuss some applications. 

### Course objectives
* learn about basic properties of graphs (bipartite, Eulerian, matchings, connectivity, colorability, planarity,...)
* prove foundational results (Menger, Hall matching, matrix tree,...); 
* understand theoretical trends in graph theory (local-to-global, duality, extremal problems, Ramsey theory); 
* investigate connections of graph theory to different areas (combinatorics, topology, linear algebra, probability); 
* improve your ability to read/write proofs and critique arguments; 
* expose you to things you haven’t seen and challenge you through problem solving.

## Recommended prerequisites

Some experience with writing proofs will help. 

## Textbook
West, _Introduction to graph theory_ 

## Course expenses
Just the textbook. In practice, the text may not be absolutely necessary for the course, although you may want it as a reference. 

## Grading
homework 30%, midterm 20%, final project 20%, final exam 20%, participation 10%

* a grade of 92% or higher is guaranteed an A
* a grade of 84% or higher is guaranteed an B
* a grade of 76% or higher is guaranteed an C

For students taking this course S/NC, a minimum grade of 70% and a minimum participation grade of 70% is necessary to receive a grade of S.

## Homework 

There will be weekly assignments posted below. The homework is designed to increase your engagement with the material, with your peers, and with me.

Collaboration is encouraged. Working with your classmates can help you learn the material better. Some of the homework problems may be difficult, so it is recommended that you talk to someone when you are stuck. That said, you are required to write your solutions alone and acknowledge the students you worked with. For any solution you submit, you should understand it well enough that you can explain it to someone else and answer questions about it. If you find yourself writing down things that you can’t explain, you should go back and think more about the problem. 

LaTeX: Homework solutions must be typed in LaTeX. If you're new to LaTeX, you can either [download](https://www.latex-project.org/get/) LaTex or use [sharelatex](https://www.sharelatex.com/) which allows you download, edit, and compile LaTeX files online. See [here](https://oeis.org/wiki/List_of_LaTeX_mathematical_symbols) for some commonly used symbols in LaTeX. Also [Detexify](http://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html) is a useful tool for finding the commands for various symbols. The source code for the assignments should be a helpful guide. The most basic thing to know/remember is that math always goes in between dollar signs. 

Late homework policy: As a general rule, late homework is not accepted. I know things happen, so I will drop your lowest assignment. For exceptional circumstances, please email me. 

### Homework assignments. 

HW1 (due 1/30). to be posted soon


## Participation

Occasionally, we may have assignments or quizzes in class. These will count toward the participation part of your grade (10%). 

You can also participate by coming to office hours and asking questions on Ed Discussion.  


## Final Project
Working in groups of 2, you'll choose a topic related to the course to investigate and create an N-minute presentation to be given during reading period. To help you prepare for this, I will ask you to submit the following. 

* Final project proposal (due 3/31)
* Final project outline (due 4/7) 
* Final project slides (due 4/14)

Additional information, as well as some potential topic ideas, will be shared later.
