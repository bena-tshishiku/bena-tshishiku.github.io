## Summary

A rigorous course in linear algebra with an emphasis on proof-writing. Topics include: construction of number systems; fields, vector spaces and linear transformations; eigenvalues and eigenvectors; inner products; spectral theorem; determinants. The plan is to work through Axler's _Linear algebra done right_ (Ch 1-7, 10) after a short introduction using Chapter 1 of Simmons' _Introduction to topology and modern analysis_. This course is part one of a two-part course -- the plan for the second semester is to work through Spivak's _Calculus on manifolds_.
