## Course information
This is an undergraduate course in differential geometry. The primary objects of study are curves and surfaces in 3-space.  This course builds on multivariable calculus and linear algebra and could be a precursor to the study of manifolds, topology, and Riemannian geometry. 

### Course objectives
* learn basic properties of curves and surfaces (lengths, area, curvature, torsion) and how to compute them; 
* prove foundational results (fundamental theorem of curves, theorem egregium, Gauss-Bonnet); 
* understand theoretical trends in differential geometry (local vs global properties, intrinsic vs extrinsic quantities); 
* improve your understanding of linear algebra and calculus by applying it; 
* investigate various applications of differential geometry (isoperimetric inequality, regular isotopy of plane curves, knots, map-making, Euler characteristic/topology); 
* improve your ability to read/write proofs and critique arguments; 
* expose you to things you haven’t seen and challenge you through problem solving.

## Recommended prerequisites

We will use multivariable calculus and linear algebra heavily and without much review during lecture. Some experience with writing proofs may be helpful. 

## Textbook
do Carmo, _Differential geometry of curves and surfaces_ 

## Course expenses
Just the textbook. In practice, the text may not be absolutely necessary for the course, although you may want it as a reference. 

## Grading
homework 35%, midterm 30%, final project 30%, participation 5%

* a grade of 90% or higher is guaranteed an A
* a grade of 80% or higher is guaranteed an B
* a grade of 70% or higher is guaranteed an C

For students taking this course S/NC, a minimum grade of 70% _and_ a minimum participation grade of 70% is required to guarantee a grade of S.

## Homework 

There will be weekly assignments posted below. The homework is designed to increase your engagement with the material, with your peers, and with me.

Collaboration: Please collaborate! Working together with your classmates can help you learn the material better. Some of the homework problems may be difficult, so it is recommended that you talk to someone when you are stuck. You are required to write your solutions alone and acknowledge the students you worked with. For any solution you submit, you should understand it well enough that you can explain it to someone else and answer questions about it. If you find yourself writing down things that you can’t explain, you should go back and think more about the problem. 

LaTeX: Homework solutions must be typed in LaTeX. If you're new to LaTeX, you can either [download](https://www.latex-project.org/get/) LaTex or use [sharelatex](https://www.sharelatex.com/) which allows you download, edit, and compile LaTeX files online. See [here](https://oeis.org/wiki/List_of_LaTeX_mathematical_symbols) for some commonly used symbols in LaTeX. Also [Detexify](http://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html) is a useful tool for finding the commands for various symbols. The source code for the assignments should be a helpful guide. The most basic thing to know/remember is that math always goes in between dollar signs. 

Late homework policy: For your homework grade, I will drop the score from your lowest assignment. View this as a one-time "get out of jail free card" in the event that you oversleep, forget, have a midterm, etc. As a general rule, late homework will not be accepted. If you have a medical emergency, I will ask for a note from a doctor or a dean. If you have an emergency that affects your ability to complete the coursework, please notify me as soon as possible.

## Participation

Occasionally, we may have small assignments or quizzes in class (randomly). These are graded on completion, more or less, and count toward the participation part of your grade (5%). 

Attending class and taking notes is a basic part of course participation. If you have to miss class, I expect that you will get notes from a classmate. 

## Course materials

* For asynchronous discussions (e.g. questions about homework) we will use Ed Discussion. You should be able to access Ed Discussion from the course Canvas page. 
* If you need additional references (outside of lecture and do Carmo), I encourage you to find the resource that works best for you. There are other popular texts by Banchoff-Lovett and Shifrin. You can also find further discussion on Wikipedia and Youtube. 


## Final Project
Working in groups of 2, you'll choose a topic and give an 15-minute presentation during reading period. 

The topic should be something related to the course that interests you. Below are some topic ideas to get you started, but you don't have to choose one of these. 

As part of completing the final project, I will ask you to submit:
