## Course summary
This is an undergraduate course in the study of graphs. Graphs appear all over the place: both in pure and applied mathematics as well as other sciences, such as chemistry, physics, computer science, and linguistics. We will focus on the theoretical aspects of graph theory, although we will also discuss some applications. 

Some highlights of what we’ll learn in this course: 
* basic properties of graphs (bipartite, Eulerian, matchings, connectivity, colorability, planarity)
* classical theorems about graphs (e.g. Hall’s matching theorem, max-flow/min-cut)
* classical algorithms about graphs (e.g. Gale-Shapely proposal algorithm)
* theoretical trends in graph theory (TONCAS, dual problems, extremal problems, spectral theory)
* applications of graph theory (4-color theorem, applications of Ramsey theory)
* how to read/write proofs and critique arguments
