## Course summary 

This is a graduate topics course centered around the topic of “signatures”, which are numerical invariants associated to quadratic forms, manifolds, knots, and more. While many things are signatures, many more things are not, and we will use the theme of signatures as an opportunity to discuss as many interesting topics as possible. This may include (depending on time and interest)
* signatures of manifolds, cobordism, Hirzebruch signature theorem
* the E8 manifold, the Poincare homology sphere, exotic spheres
* knots, Seifert surfaces, concordance, fibered knots
* conjugacy of symplectic matrices, the symplectic group, Maslov index
* Novikov additivity, signature cocycle for surface bundles
* SL(2,ℤ), signature defect, connection to modular forms
* Sturm’s theorem (counting real roots of a polynomial)
