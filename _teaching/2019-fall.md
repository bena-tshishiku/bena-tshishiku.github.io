## Summary 

This is a graduate course on algebraic topology, which aims to study topological spaces with algebraic invariants. The spaces of interest will be cell complexes, manifolds, and covering spaces; the primary invariants we will study are the fundamental group and homology. This course is part one of a two-part course.
