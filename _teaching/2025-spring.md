## Homework 

There will be weekly assignments posted below and submitted on Gradescope. The homework is designed to increase your engagement with the material, with your peers, and with me.

Collaboration/academic honesty: Please collaborate, and ask for help if you are stuck. You are required to write your solutions alone and acknowledge the students you worked with. If you find yourself writing down things that you canâ€™t explain, you should go back and think more about the problem. 

LaTeX: Homework solutions must be typed in LaTeX. 

Late homework policy: For your homework grade, I will drop the score from your lowest assignment. View this as a one-time "get out of jail free card" in the event that you oversleep, forget, have a midterm, etc. As a general rule, late homework will not be accepted. If you have a medical emergency, I will ask for a note from a doctor or a dean. If you have an emergency that affects your ability to complete the coursework, please notify me as early as possible. 

### Homework assignments. 

HW1 (due 1/31). [coming soon](https://bena-tshishiku.github.io/files/courses/2025-spring/242-hw1.tex)

## Course materials

* For asynchronous discussions (e.g. questions about homework) we will use campuswire. Join [here](https://campuswire.com/p/GF38334F8) with access code 5653. This is the preferred way to ask questions about the homework or point out typos (rather than emailing me). 


## Final Project
Working in groups of 2, you'll choose a topic and give an N-minute presentation during reading period. 

The topic should be something related to the course that interests you. 

As part of completing the final project, I will ask you to submit: 
* A project proposal (due April 4) 
* A project outline (due April 11) 
* A draft of final presentation slides or talk notes (due April 18)

Additional information to come.
