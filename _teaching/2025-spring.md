## Announcements

* (3/28) Final project proposals are due Friday 4/4. This is your homework for the week! Instructions [here](https://bena-tshishiku.github.io/files/courses/2025-spring/final-project-proposal.pdf). I put a list of possible ideas to get you started. You are free to choose something else. 

## Course information
This is part two of a graduate course on algebraic topology. The main topics will be cohomology, Poincare duality, and homotopy theory. 

### Course objectives

Prove foundational results, do computations, understand theoretical trends, see applications. 

## Prerequisites

Math 2410. 

## Textbooks
* Hatcher, _Algebraic topology_
* Bredon, _Topology and geometry_


## Course expenses
Potentially none. Both textbooks are available online (Bredon through the Brown library webpage).

## Grading
homework 30%, 1st midterm 30%, 2nd midterm 30%, final project 10%

## Contact information 

* Instructor: Bena Tshishiku (bena_tshishiku at brown.edu)

## Course events 

Lectures: Tu-Th 9-10:20am in Kassar 105

Office hours: 

* Tuesday 10:30-11:30 
* Wednesday 4-5, or 5-6 in weeks with a department colloquium
* or by appointment

Important dates: 
* Midterm 1: Week of March 3 (tentative)
* Midterm 2: Week of April 14 (tentative)
* Final projects: presented in class during reading period

## Homework 

There will be weekly assignments posted below and submitted on Gradescope. The homework is designed to increase your engagement with the material, with your peers, and with me.

Collaboration/academic honesty: Please collaborate, and ask for help if you are stuck. You are required to write your solutions alone and acknowledge the students you worked with. If you find yourself writing down things that you canâ€™t explain, you should go back and think more about the problem. 

LaTeX: Homework solutions must be typed in LaTeX. 

Late homework policy: For your homework grade, I will drop the score from your lowest assignment. View this as a one-time "get out of jail free card" in the event that you oversleep, forget, have a midterm, etc. As a general rule, late homework will not be accepted. If you have a medical emergency, I will ask for a note from a doctor or a dean. If you have an emergency that affects your ability to complete the coursework, please notify me as early as possible. 

### Homework assignments. 

HW1 (due 1/31). [tex file](https://bena-tshishiku.github.io/files/courses/2025-spring/242-hw1.tex), [selected student solutions](https://bena-tshishiku.github.io/files/courses/2025-spring/hw1-student.pdf)

HW2 (due 2/14). [tex file](https://bena-tshishiku.github.io/files/courses/2025-spring/242-hw2.tex), [selected student solutions](https://bena-tshishiku.github.io/files/courses/2025-spring/hw2-student.pdf)

HW3 (due 2/28). [tex file](https://bena-tshishiku.github.io/files/courses/2025-spring/242-hw3.tex), [selected student solutions](https://bena-tshishiku.github.io/files/courses/2025-spring/hw3-student.pdf)

HW4 (due 3/21). [tex file](https://bena-tshishiku.github.io/files/courses/2025-spring/242-hw4.tex)


## Course materials

* For asynchronous discussions (e.g. questions about homework) we will use campuswire. Join [here](https://campuswire.com/p/GF38334F8) with access code 5653. This is the preferred way to ask questions about the homework or point out typos (rather than emailing me). 


## Final Project
Working in groups of 2, you'll choose a topic and give an N-minute presentation during reading period. 

The topic should be something related to the course that interests you. 

As part of completing the final project, I will ask you to submit: 
* A project proposal (due April 4) 
* A project outline (due April 11) 
* A draft of final presentation slides or talk notes (due April 18)

Some project ideas: 

* Pontryagin-Thom theorem and stable homotopy groups
* cobordism groups
* Hopf invariant 
* plus construction and (algebraic) K-theory
* vector bundles and topological K-theory
* group cohomology and group extensions 
* Nerve theorem and application 
* H-spaces and Hopf algebras
* Local coefficients
* Brown representability 
* spectra and (co)homology theories
* Steenrod squares
* Grassmannians and classifying spaces 
* Lefschetz fixed point theorem 
* J-homomorphism and stable homotopy groups
* Bott periodicity
* Alexander duality
* Extra topics in Hatcher or Bredon or found elsewhere
* Manifolds are cell complexes
