## Course expenses
Potentially none. Both textbooks are available online (Bredon through the Brown library webpage).

## Grading

## Course events 

Lectures: Tu-Th 9-10:20am in 85 Waterman Room 015

Office hours: Tuesday 4:30-5:30 and Thursday 3-4 in 111 Thayer Room 114

Important dates: 
* Midterm 1: 
* Midterm 2: 
* Final projects: presented in class during reading period

## Homework 

There will be weekly assignments posted below. The homework is designed to increase your engagement with the material, with your peers, and with me.

Collaboration: Please collaborate, and ask for help if you are stuck. You are required to write your solutions alone and acknowledge the students you worked with. If you find yourself writing down things that you canâ€™t explain, you should go back and think more about the problem. 

LaTeX: Homework solutions must be typed in LaTeX. 

Late homework policy: For your homework grade, I will drop the score from your lowest assignment. View this as a one-time "get out of jail free card" in the event that you oversleep, forget, have a midterm, etc. As a general rule, late homework will not be accepted. If you have a medical emergency, I will ask for a note from a doctor or a dean. If you have an emergency that affects your ability to complete the coursework, please notify me as early as possible.

## Final Project
Working in groups of 2, you'll choose a topic and give an N-minute presentation during reading period. 

The topic should be something related to the course that interests you. I will suggest some topics later. 

As part of completing the final project, I will ask you to submit: 
* A project proposal 
* A project outline 
* Final presentation slides
