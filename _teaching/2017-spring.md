This was a course on mapping class groups of surfaces. Topics included: 

1. Algebraic structure of mapping class groups 
  * finite generation 
  * presentation
  * abelianization
3. Surface bundles 
  * Over the circle: multiple fiberings, Thurston norm
  * Over surfaces: signature, Atiyah–Kodaira examples, surface subgroups of Modg
  * Characteristic classes: Miller–Morita–Mumford classes
3. Mumford conjecture.
  * Harer’s homological stability theorem
  * Madsen–Weiss theorem
  * Homotopy type of diffeomorphism groups, Earle–Eells theorem
4. Lifting problems for Mod_g
  * Morita’s nonlifting theorem, flat connections on surface bundles
  * Lifting problems for surface braid groups
