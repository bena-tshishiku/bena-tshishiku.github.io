## Course summary

This is an undergraduate course in topology, which studies properties of geometric objects. In this course we will learn 
* basic principles of topology (e.g. topological invariants, point-set notions); 
* proofs of famous classical results (Heine-Borel, van Kampen, Brouwer fixed point, classification of surfaces); 
* connections of topology to other areas of math (free groups, fundamental theorem of algebra) and to the world (robots, hanging pictures, car shades); 
* how to calculate topological invariants such as Euler number and fundamental group; 
* how to read/write proofs and critique arguments, especially those that are based on pictures/visualization.
