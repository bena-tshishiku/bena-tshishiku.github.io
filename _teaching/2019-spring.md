## Summary 

This course is focused on the study of functions of several variables, a topic broadly referred to as mathematical analysis. This will include differentiation, integration, and rigorous proofs of the classical theorems of calculus in a broad setting. One of the central goals of the course is to introduce you to proof-writing and abstract mathematical thinking.
