## Summary 

In this course, we'll pursue a rigorous treatment of linear algebra. Topics include set theory, vector spaces and bases, linear maps, determinants, eigenvectors, inner products, and spectral theory. The plan is to work through Axler's Linear algebra done right, although we will use some other resources as well (see Course Materials below). This course is part one of a two-semester journey -- the second semester will be real analysis and multivariable calculus. 

The goals of the course include: 
1. Learning how to read and write proofs, and how to critique an argument. Learning to think carefully, logically, and rigorously. Learning to communicate math clearly and effectively.
2. Learn both theoretical and computational aspects of linear algebra. More emphasis will be on the former, although both are important!
3. Learn to use LaTeX. See the section on Homework below.
4. Create a fun environment/community for learning and discussing math.
