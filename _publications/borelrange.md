In this note, we remark on the range in Borel's theorem on the stable cohomology of 
the arithmetic groups Sp(2n,Z) and SO(n,n;Z).  The main result improves the range stated 
in Borelâ€™s original papers, an improvement that was known to Borel. The proof is a technical 
computation involving the Weyl group action on roots and weights.
