In this note, we remark on the range in Borel's theorem on the stable cohomology of 
the arithmetic groups Sp(2n,Z) and SO(n,n;Z).  The main result improves the range stated 
in Borelâ€™s original papers, an improvement that was known to Borel. The proof is a technical 
computation involving the Weyl group action on roots and weights.

Bestvina-Mess showed that the duality properties of a group are encoded in any 
boundary that gives a Z-set compactification; in particular, a hyperbolic group 
with Gromov boundary S^n is a PD(n+1) group. For relatively hyperbolic pairs (G,P), 
the natural boundary -- the Bowditch boundary -- does not give a Z-set compactification of G. 
Nevertheless we show that if the Bowditch boundary of (G,P) is S^2, then (G,P) is a PD(3) pair.
