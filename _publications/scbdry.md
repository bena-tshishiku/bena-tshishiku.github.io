The fundamental group of a closed aspherical manifold M is an 
example of a Poincare duality group. Whether or not all 
finitely presented Poincare duality groups arise in this fashion 
is an open problem that goes back to Wall. This paper addresses a 
relative version of this problem for a special class of groups. 
Fixing n>6, we show that if G is a torsion-free hyperbolic group 
whose visual boundary is an (n-2)-dimensional Sierpinski space, then 
G = pi_1(W) for some aspherical n-manifold W with boundary. The proof 
involves the total surgery obstruction and is based on work of Bartels-Lueck-Weinberger. 
Concerning the converse, we construct examples of aspherical manifolds with 
boundary whose fundamental group is hyperbolic but with visual boundary not homeomorphic to a Sierpinski space.
