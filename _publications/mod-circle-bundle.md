In this paper, we study the algebraic structure of mapping class group 
of 3-manifolds that fiber as a circle bundle over a surface. 
This mapping class group surjects to the mapping class group of the base surface. 
We determine when this surjection splits. In the process we relate the 3-manifold 
mapping class group to the Birman exact sequence.
