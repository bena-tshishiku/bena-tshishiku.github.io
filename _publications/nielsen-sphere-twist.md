For a 3-manifold M, the twist group Twist(M) is the subgroup of the 
mapping class group Mod(M) generated by twists about embedded 2-spheres. 
We study the Nielsen realization problem for subgroups of Twist(M). 
We prove that a group G<Twist(M) is realized by diffeomorphisms if and 
only if G is cyclic and M is a connected sum of lens spaces.
