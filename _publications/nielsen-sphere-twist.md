For a 3-manifold M, the twist group Twist(M) is the subgroup of the 
mapping class group Mod(M) generated by twists about embedded 2-spheres. 
We study the Nielsen realization problem for subgroups of Twist(M). 
We prove that a group G<Twist(M) is realized by diffeomorphisms if and 
only if G is cyclic and M is a connected sum of lens spaces. 

Correction: The remark about a counterexample to equivariant geometrization of 3-manifolds is incorrect (i.e. there is no counterexample). Note that a geometric metric on S^2 â¨‰ S^1 is not necessarily a product metric.
