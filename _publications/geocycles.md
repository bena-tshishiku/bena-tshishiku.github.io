A basic problem in the study of fiber bundles is to compute the ring H*(BDiff(M)) 
of characteristic classes of bundles with fiber a smooth manifold M. When M is a surface, 
this problem has ties to algebraic topology, geometric group theory, and algebraic geometry. 
We have a good understanding of the cohomology in the stable range, but this accounts for a 
small percentage of the total cohomology, and little is known beyond that. In this paper we produce new 
classes (independent from the stable classes) for some special M that come from the unstable 
cohomology of arithmetic groups.  Dually these nontrivial characteristic classes imply the existence 
of new topologically interesting manifold bundles. We also give an application to bundles with fiber a K3 surface.
