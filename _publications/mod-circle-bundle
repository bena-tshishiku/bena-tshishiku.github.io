In this paper, we study the algebraic structure of mapping class group 
$\Mod(X)$ of 3-manifolds $X$ that fiber as a circle bundle over a surface 
$S^1\to X\to S_g$. There is an exact sequence $1\to H^1(S_g)\to \Mod(X)\to\Mod(S_g)\to1$. 
We relate this to the Birman exact sequence and determine when this sequence splits.
