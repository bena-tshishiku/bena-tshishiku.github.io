In the 1960s Atiyah and Kodaira constructed surface bundles over 
surfaces with many interesting properties. The topology of such a 
bundle is completely encoded in its monodromy representation (a homomorphism to a mapping class group), 
and it is a fundamental problem to understand precisely how the topology of 
the bundle is reflected in algebraic properties of the monodromy. 
The main result of this paper is that the Atiyahâ€“Kodaira bundles have arithmetic monodromy groups.
This addresses a question of Griffiths-Schmid. As an application, using work of N. Salter and L. Chen, 
we show that Atiyah-Kodaira bundles fiber in exactly two ways.
