For every compact surface we show that when n is sufficiently large there is no lift 
of the surface braid group Br(n,S) to Diff(S,n), the group of diffeomorphisms 
preserving n marked points and restricting to the identity on the boundary. 
This generalizes work of Bestvina-Church-Souto, but our main tool (the Thurston stability theorem) is different. 
Our methods are applied to give a new proof of Morita's non-lifting theorem in the best possible range. 
These techniques extend to the more general setting of spaces of codimension-2 embeddings, 
and we obtain corresponding results for spherical motion groups, including the string motion group.
