Locally symmetric spaces like SL(n,ℤ)\SL_n(ℝ)/SO(n) contain immersed 
compact flat manifolds of dimension equal to the real rank. We give a 
lower bound for the contribution of these cycles to the homology of congruence 
covers. Similar results are proved for other families of locally symmetric spaces. 

Note: there is a simpler proof of the main results, which we learned from a referee. This has not yet been incorporated into the draft.
