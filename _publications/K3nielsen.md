Let K be the K3 manifold. In this note, we discuss two methods 
to prove that certain generalized Miller-Morita-Mumford classes for 
smooth bundles with fiber K are non-zero. As a consequence, we fill a 
gap in a paper of the first author, and prove that the homomorphism 
Diff(K)â†’pi_0Diff(K) does not split. One of the two methods of proof uses 
a result of Franke on the stable cohomology of arithmetic groups that 
strengthens work of Borel, and may be of independent interest.
