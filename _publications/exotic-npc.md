We study finite group actions on smooth manifolds of the form W#Σ, 
where Σ is an exotic n-sphere and W is either a hyperbolic or a flat manifold. 
We completely classify the finite cyclic groups that act freely on an exotic 
torus T^n#Σ. For hyperbolic manifolds M, we produce examples M#Σ that admit no 
nontrivial smooth action of a finite group, while Isom(M) is arbitrarily large.
