This paper is about cohomology of mapping class groups of surfaces. One source of cohomology classes is the symplectic representation R: Mod(S) --> Sp(2g,Z). The image of the induced map on cohomology --  in the stable range and with rational coefficients -- is the algebra generated by the odd Miller-Morita-Mumford (MMM) classes. In this paper we extend this example to the centralizer of a finite cyclic subgroup G of the mapping class group Mod(S)^G --> Sp(2g,Z)^G. The main result of this paper is a computation of the induced map on cohomology in degree 2 when G is a finite cyclic group. We apply this computation to compute Toledo invariants of surface group representations to SU(p,q) arising from the Atiyah-Kodaira construction, and we show that cohomology classes in the image give equivariant cobordism invariants for surface bundles with fiberwise G action, following Church-Farb-Thibault.
