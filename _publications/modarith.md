This paper is about cohomology of mapping class groups of surfaces. One source of cohomology classes is the symplectic representation R: Mod(S) --> Sp(2g,Z). A well-known computation shows that the image of R*: H*( Sp(2g,Z) ;Q) --> H*( Mod(S) ;Q) is the algebra generated by the odd Miller-Morita-Mumford (MMM) classes in the stable range. In this paper we extend this example. Let G < Diff(S) be a finite group, and consider the centralizer Mod(S)^G in Mod(S). There is a homomorphism R: Mod(S)^G --> Sp(2g,Z)^G. The main result of this paper is a computation of the induced map on cohomology in degree 2 when G is a finite cyclic group. We apply this computation to compute Toledo invariants of surface group representations to SU(p,q) arising from the Atiyah-Kodaira construction, and we show that classes in the image of R* gives equivariant cobordism invariants for surface bundles with fiberwise G action, following Church-Farb-Thibault.
