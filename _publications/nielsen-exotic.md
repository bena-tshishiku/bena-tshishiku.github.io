Let N be a smooth manifold that’s homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic 
to a closed hyperbolic manifold M. In this paper, we study the extent 
to which N admits as much symmetry as M. On the one hand, we find N with 
maximal symmetry, i.e. Isom(M) acts on N by isometries with respect to 
some negatively curved metric on N. For these examples, Isom(M) can be 
made arbitrarily large. On the other hand, we find N with little symmetry, 
i.e. no subgroup of Isom(M) of “small” index acts by diffeomorphisms of N.
