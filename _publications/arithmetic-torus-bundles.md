We study when the group ℤ^n⋊ℤ  is arithmetic, where ℤ acts on ℤ^n by a 
hyperbolic, semisimple A∈ GL(n,ℤ). We give a characterization of arithmeticity 
phrased in the language of algebraic tori, building on work of Grunewald– Platonov. 
We use this to prove several more concrete results that relate the arithmeticity 
to the reducibility properties of the characteristic polynomial of A. Our tools 
include algebraic tori, representation theory of finite groups, Galois theory, 
and the inverse Galois problem.
