I'm an assistant professor at Brown University working in geometry and topology. I received my PhD in 2015 at UChicago, advised by Benson Farb. After that I was an NSF postdoc at Stanford and a BP postdoc at Harvard. 

My work primarily relates to manifolds, fiber bundles, mapping class groups, diffeomorphism groups, and arithmetic groups.
